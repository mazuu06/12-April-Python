Question 1: Maximum possible value of an integer in python ?
==> In python 3.x we can store unlimited int value in a variable, but in python 2.x we can store limited int in variable. For more long int values we use "long int".

Question 2: Global and Local Variables ?
==> Those variable which can we use in whole program called global variable. A variable that can we access within a function, method or class known as local variable

Question 3: Packing and Unpacking Arguments in Python ?
==> If we want to parse members of list to a function we unpack this list and send to that function. For example function(*list)
If we don,t know how many arguments will recieve in a function we Pack the arguments with (*).  For dictionary we use (**) before parameter.

Question 4: Type conversion in python ?
==> Converting value of one data type into other datatype called type conversion. For example: Convert a int value into string.

Question 5: Byte objects vs string in python ?
==> Bytes are text that human can't read but computer can read this. Strings are text that human understand easily but computer does not understand. We can convert string to byte and byte to string using encoding and decoding.

Question 6: Print single and multiple variable ?
==> In python we can easily print single and multiple values by using just print function. For example: print(45, "Hello", 2.4, True)

Question 7: Swap variable ?
==> Storing a value of variable or result of multiple variables into a single variable is known as variable swaping.

Question 8: Private variables ?
==> The variables or methods that we can access only within a class called private variables.

Question 9: name (A Special variable) in Python ?
==> In a normal program __name__ is equal to __main__ but when we import a externel module then __name__ is equal to module name. we use __name__ variable when we are writing a library or a external module.
